## LeetCode Study Plan

### Coding Preparation

- **Company Filter**: Google
- **Approach**:
  - Allocate 45 minutes to understand the solution and then implement it.
  - Thoroughly read each LeetCode solution explanation.
  - For every problem:
    - **Front of the Note Card**: Question
    - **Back of the Note Card**:
      - High-level solution
      - Running time
      - Space complexity
      - Noteworthy details about the algorithm
